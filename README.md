# Tablist
Updated Version of the Tablist Plugin for newer spigot versions. Note: I only updated the plugin to work again, I didn't add any
features nor fix any potential bugs. Neither did I clean up the more then messy codebase, this build is simply to continue support for
the plugin on newer builds without spamming your console with error messages

Supported versions:
* 1.16.*
* 1.15.*
* 1.14.*
Older versions may or may not work, but for those the original build from spigotmc can be used
